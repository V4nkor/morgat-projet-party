# morgat-projet-party

## Description

A vueJS frontend and Java Spring boot backend for a solo Evaluation project in the "Backend Optimisation" Course at Sup de Vinci.
You can find the instructions for the project at `docs/projet-party-instructions.pdf`.
The very badly made and not correct MCD for the database can be found at `docs/mcd.png`.
The frontend is a WIP and was a secondary concern in this project, since the backend was the more important part (and the frontend is optional).

## Project setup

Make sure you have pnpm installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by running `npm install -g pnpm`.
